# Material UI React

Pros

- Well documented
- Very nice looking for the time it takes to make it (very "googl-y")
- Pretty easy to use by copy pasting examples from the docs
- Smooth mobile friendly nav bar mostly out of the box
- Lots of pre-built examples and layouts for components
- Button clicks look really great and animated
- Free templates https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/v5.8.7/docs/data/material/getting-started/templates

Cons

- Similar to chakra-ui, lots of custom components that raise a bit the learning curve and it takes a bit of time of getting used to be productive ("one more tool to learn"). Reminds me to Flutter too.
- Poor color palette
- Need to import many components for each thing
- No file input (yet)
- Date input seems a bit complicated and requires external packages
- It would take time to get familiar with all the components

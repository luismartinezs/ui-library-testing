# Tailwind UI

Using the free tier only

Pros:

- It's just tailwind
- Pre-designed templates that look really great, very good looking
- Easy theming
- It's very "minimal". In conjunction with Headless UI, it is the opposite of chakra-ui. Everything is just regular JSX with tailwind classes, except for a few custom un-styled components from Headless UI
- Customizable by design, very easy to customize. This is good for any project

Cons:

- Costs (a bit of) money (but it's only one payment)
- Tailwind classes can make components look really bloated
- At least the free stuff is hard and slow to customize, because of how big the templates are, in other words, it's not great for quick prototyping out of the box
- Relies on Headless UI, Heroicons, and a number of tailwind plugins, that need separate installs (this doesn't need to be a bad thing, honestly, but I'm not exactly sure it's good either)
- Components provided are huge, non-reusable out of the box, and need to be split and refactored manually

Time: 1:16, I couldn't do 4 of the components because of lack of free resources. I did 7 of them. So roughly, it would have taken around **2 hours** to do all 11

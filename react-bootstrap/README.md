# React bootstrap

Pros:

- Very easy to setup
- In general, very quick to work with components out of the box, great for quick prototyping
- Leverages react
- Good modal utilities
- Mostly copy-paste from docs
- Nicely contained components (import component and everything is inside that import)

Cons:

- Docs spread in between react bootstrap and bootstrap
- No css normalization out of the box
- Few color classes, need to be generated explicitly
- Ugly default style, very "bootstrap-y", and probably hard to customize
- Lots of text utility classes, with decent defaults, but nothing like tailwind-typography

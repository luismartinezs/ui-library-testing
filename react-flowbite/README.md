# React Flowbite

Pros

- Comes with heroicons
- "It's just tailwind", kind of
- It includes dark theme classes
- Looks a lot like react-bootstrap in the way custom components are used
- It's really simple to use
- Straightforward to use
- Even if I don't want to use the react components, I can use the pre-built class sets from vanilla flowbite


Cons

- Poor documentation with errors / outdated
- Theme customization is experimental for now
- The non-react version is just a bunch of pre-made html with tailwind classes (which is fine), the react version is very "bootstrap-y"
- It's kind of ugly, design-wise
- No text utilities or components, i.e. just use tailwind

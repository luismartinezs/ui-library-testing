# Chakra ui

Pros

- a11y first citizen
- Lots of layout utility components
- Theme seems easy to customize
- Good amount of built-in colors (similar to tailwind. Tailwind is better still)

Cons

- Styles as props, similar to tailwind but every class has its prop, seems a bit over-engineered
- **Everything** is a custom component. No vanilla html. Feels very over-engineered. Reminds me of Flutter. But nothing prevents me from using vanilla html
- No built-in card out of the box
- No built-in layouts, like footer or header
- No "normalize"
- It's complicated, "one more thing to learn". It is really hard to be productive with this thing at first.
- I hate this, it's way too complicated
- Terrible file input out of the box
- Checkbox seems broken
